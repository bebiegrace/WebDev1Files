	<h1>Bebie Grace Balbuena</h1>
	<p>Hello! I am Bebie Grace, but you can call me "Bebie" all the way from Manduyong, Badian, Cebu.<br>
I am an ordinary girl who love watching stars and sunset, as it can refresh my system and can make my<br> mind at peace.
When I see its beautiful view it feels like I’m in the world that full of happiness, no worries,<br> struggles, chaos like everything is all set and perfect.</p>
	<p>Another thing is that I like reading different kinds of books when I am interested or curious about<br> something, especially reading emotional and meaningful stories.
Farther more, planting plants and flowers<br> had been also my habits early in the morning, I love organizing it and want to take good care of it until it will be satisfying to look at.</p>
                   <p>Being a person who wants to become a better individual, I always said to myself that“everything is going to be alright” for it is just a challenge<br> for me to achieve my goals.
And just go with the flow since I believe that “everything happens for a reason” with that, I can make hard things become easy to handle. </p>
                    <p>Other than that, when I am in a worst situation, I always think positive and it can really make me feel at ease and in peace,<br>
that in every challenges and difficulties we encounter, there should always be reasons behind and it will lead us to our destiny that awaits.</p>
