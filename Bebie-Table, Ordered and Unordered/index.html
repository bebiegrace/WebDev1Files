        <h1>Bebie Grace Balbuena</h1>
        <h2>Life is too short!! So let's unite and enjoy the beauty of the universe!</h2>
	    <p>Hello! I am Bebie Grace, but you can call me "Bebie" all the way from Manduyong, Badian, Cebu.
            I am an ordinary girl who loves watching stars and sunset, as it can refresh my system and can make my mind at peace.
            When I see its beautiful view it feels like I’m in a world that is full of happiness, no worries, struggles, chaos like everything is all set and perfect.
            Another thing is that I like reading different kinds of books when I am interested or curious about something, especially reading emotional and meaningful stories.
            Farther more, planting plants and flowers had been also my habits early in the morning,I love organizing it and want to take good care of it until it will be satisfying to look at.
            Being a person who wants to become a better individual, I always said to myself that“everything is going to be alright” for it is just a challenge for me to achieve my goals.
            And just go with the flow since I believe that “everything happens for a reason” with that, I can make hard things become easy to handle.
            Other than that, when I am in a worst situation, I always think positive and it can really make me feel at ease and in peace, that in every challenges and difficulties we encounter, there should always be reasons behind and it will lead us to our destiny that awaits.</p>
